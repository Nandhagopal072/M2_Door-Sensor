# REPORT
The proposed system consists of an Atmega8 microcontroller, LEDs, buttons, and voltage. 
The system uses sensors replaced by switches and resistors to control the lighting in the room. 
The purpose of the project is to automatically detect the door and turn off the lights. 
This project is designed to automatically turn on / off the lights connected to the door. 
The device provides information about the condition of the door via the internal circuit ATMEGA328, where the door acting as a switch uses a motion sensor to detect if it is in the room  and power on the device. Make changes. 
The Door Sensor Project is a simple project based on the Door Sensor and Atmega328 that detects people and objects and automatically opens and closes the door. 
The door sensor is connected to bit 1 of port B and the LED is connected to bit 6 of port C.  
An AVRC program that monitors door sensors, opening the LED to turn it on and closing it to turn it off. c is embedded. 
Door sensors can be used in shopping malls, cinemas, hospitals, etc., and the door will open automatically as soon as a person approaches the door. 
The real-time clock works because the resistance value reaches its maximum at midnight. After that, the light will turn on for 2-3 minutes and then turn off automatically. 
## Pass all test cases 
## Therefore, the project results are designed to be effectively implemented  and executed.
