## Procedure

* atmega328 is interfaced with LED and proxymity sensor .
* the sensor is attached with the door. 
* when the door is open ,the sensor gives signal to the microcontroller.
* the microcontroller pass the signal to LED ,the LED starts to blink.
* when the door is close,then LED stops blinking.

## For Testing and using code

* For simulation purposes use simulide .
* To run the code use codeblocks.
* In Code Blocks you can also RUN the program in both LINUX and WINDOWS.
